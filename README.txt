This repository is for an updated version of an Arduino library, orignally sourced from https://www.laserlance.com/projects/arduino-dac-library-and-shield/,
for the AD57X4 line of digital-to-analog converters by Analog Devices. This library allows an Arduino to control one of the DACs in question. The repository
also includes a file of Python wrapper functions for controlling the Arduino from another program.
